### Wal-Mart The Retail Giant

## Objective

Walmart is an American operator of discount stores that is one of the world’s biggest retailers and among the world’s largest corporations.The objective behind using this API for my project is to facilitate and guide a large group of customers with an easy accessibility to the store for solving their various queries. I am attempting to resolve the following questions in my project:

 1. How to check for the Item price and availability?
 2. How to locate a Walmart store at a particular location?
 3. How to find matching items available for sale online? 
 
 The following is the API that I would be using for my project:

## Motivation

I found this API interesting for my project, since walmart is one of the most visited store by families for their daily needs and I being a parent of three kids find it as an one-stop shop and a must visit on my list almost every week. In this fast paced world, these kind of applications gives the customers the options to shop by finding the nearest store locations and with the prior knowledge of the product availability and price it becomes less time consuming and accessible. Even though there are variety of options available for shopping at different stores, walmart still stands out and maintains a wide customer base with its various offers and commitment to satisfy all categories of customers.
